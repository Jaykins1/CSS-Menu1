# CSS Menu
I created a simple menu list, contains for options, each linking to another page where purchase is made. 

## Description
This menu contains a list of meals such as Appetizer, entrees, desserts, and beverages. each meal is linked to another page. and is style to have a desplay value of block, allowing the elements take up the full width of the parent container. The content of the menu is aligned to the center of the webpage giving it a simple look.
